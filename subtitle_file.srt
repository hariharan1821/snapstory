1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:01,299
hello guys so my name is krushnayak and

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:03,580
welcome to my YouTube channel so guys uh

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:05,860
we will continue the end-to-end machine

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:08,379
learning project series now uh you know

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,440
till now I have uploaded nine tutorials

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,540
uh I have to probably rename this uh

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Project Playlist not seven days but

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:17,740
it'll be more now because since I'm

9
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:19,539
going to add ml Ops cicd pipeline GitHub

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,600
action so everything will get added

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,160
right so uh in the last tutorial we had

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,400
actually done the deployment in AWS

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,320
Beanstalk now in this video we will

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,900
consider a project and we'll try to

15
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:33,279
deploy that in the Azure but before I go

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,800
ahead I really want to give a quick

17
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:37,899
shout out to one of the subscriber his

18
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,480
name is utkarsh okay so utkarsh guy quad

19
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,140
so what he has done is that after

20
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,280
learning from this entire project right

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,079
now uh he has actually created a new

22
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:49,899
project with respect to a new data set

23
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,820
and the data set over here that he's

24
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,460
specifically using and the problem

25
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:55,660
statement is he's using is something

26
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,280
called as gemstone price prediction now

27
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,340
in this gemstone price is prediction we

28
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,620
are going to predict the price of the

29
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:04,059
gemstone based on features like ID carat

30
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:06,820
cut color Clarity depth table everything

31
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,340
right and we have to probably give the

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,560
uh you know find out the price so this

33
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:13,659
was probably from a kaggle competition

34
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,340
over here you can probably see this

35
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,320
kaggle uh entire information is given

36
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,540
about this data set amazingly

37
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,340
implemented solution most of the

38
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:23,979
techniques that he has used inside the

39
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:25,659
source folder he has basically used the

40
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,400
same project structure same folder

41
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:29,799
structure so if you are able to follow

42
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,960
this entire playlist he has basically

43
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,060
followed this playlist and he has

44
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,920
created all these things see data

45
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,720
transformation everything like how we

46
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,700
specifically used he has just used

47
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:41,619
different different features and he has

48
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,180
followed the same pattern okay so a good

49
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,119
amazing uh shout out to utkarsh for

50
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,479
doing this amazing work and sharing it

51
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,159
with the entire audience he had posted

52
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,500
in the LinkedIn so I thought of why not

53
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,079
representing this particular project I

54
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,060
will take this project now and I'll

55
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,439
deploy that in Azure again guys I'm

56
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,140
clearly saying the credit goes to

57
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,600
utkarsh for this project okay my project

58
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,240
is also there like which I had actually

59
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,860
developed it is almost similar but here

60
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,080
now what we are going to do we are going

61
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,700
to take this project and we are going to

62
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,080
do the deployment in Azure okay so

63
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,060
quickly if you go and see in the vs code

64
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,680
this is how the project structure looks

65
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,360
like you know you have your notebook

66
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,340
files EDM model training everything is

67
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,400
here and he is really really represented

68
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:26,739
written all the nodes very much cleanly

69
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,020
so you can definitely refer this okay ah

70
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,200
but if you want to implement it please

71
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,660
make sure that you see that entire

72
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,400
playlist okay uh already in the playlist

73
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,700
we have developed about nine tutorials

74
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,440
I'll also give the playlist link now

75
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,480
what we are going to do quickly

76
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,220
I'm going to put this particular project

77
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,319
inside my GitHub so inside my GitHub

78
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,180
I've taken the entire copy of the

79
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,560
project I did not do the fork the reason

80
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,140
I did not do the fork because I need to

81
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,580
make some changes for the deployment in

82
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:55,959
Azure okay now what I will do all this

83
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,140
commit is basically happened now I'll go

84
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
ahead and open my Azure right now in

85
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:03,819
Azure we are going to create a web app

86
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,860
and then we are going to do the

87
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
deployment please note over here all the

88
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,080
step to step process that we are going

89
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,640
to follow this will be a continuous

90
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,680
deployment mechanism that we are going

91
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,300
to follow over here so first of all I

92
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
will go ahead and sign in so quickly go

93
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,319
ahead and sign in over here now after

94
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,480
you sign in it will ask for your

95
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,700
username and password please do that now

96
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,220
if you really want to deploy this in a

97
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,260
Azure webs app right and we'll do it

98
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,420
with the help of GitHub actions okay

99
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:32,980
automatically the GitHub action will

100
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:34,959
also get created now first of all I will

101
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,360
go ahead and create the resource okay

102
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,860
inside the resource I will be having web

103
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,200
app so we'll go ahead and create this

104
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,940
web app now once this web app is created

105
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,760
I'm going to get this information like

106
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,340
subscription I'm probably using right

107
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:50,019
now ineuron Azure so over here

108
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,360
subscription one group is there you have

109
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,159
to also create it if not whatever by

110
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,620
default value is coming you use that

111
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
we'll create a new Resource Group let's

112
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,040
say I'm going to write test group

113
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,760
regression okay so this will be my

114
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,840
Resource Group which will create the web

115
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:06,459
app inside this then I have to give my

116
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,920
web app name let's say I'm writing gem

117
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,260
prediction gem price prediction okay so

118
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,439
gem price prediction this will basically

119
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:16,299
be my entire URL because after the

120
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,340
deployment will be looking like gem

121
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,720
prediction dot azurewebsite.net we are

122
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:22,419
going to do this with GitHub action

123
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,680
please note all the step by step okay

124
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,720
then right now will be in code later on

125
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:28,419
I'll also show you Dockers okay I will

126
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,400
try to convert this entire project into

127
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,780
Docker and then show you then uh after

128
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,720
selecting you have to select the runtime

129
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,220
in runtime I will go ahead and select

130
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,900
python 3.8 and now I will just go ahead

131
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,020
and click on next after next it will ask

132
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,840
for the GitHub action settings okay now

133
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,360
GitHub action setting is very much

134
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,860
simple just go ahead and enable it and

135
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,620
make sure that you configure with your

136
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,060
GitHub account right now I have

137
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,320
configured with my GitHub account if you

138
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,940
want to configure just click on change

139
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,620
account and it'll ask you to configure

140
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,600
from here okay so in order to sign in it

141
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,360
will ask you for the authentication just

142
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,800
go ahead and do the authentication now

143
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,780
we'll select the organization it is

144
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,160
Krishna x06 because it is inside my

145
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:08,699
repository my repository name is student

146
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,580
ml project regression now see what will

147
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,199
happen okay so here I will write student

148
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,460
student ml project regression right so

149
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,120
this is uh this is my GitHub right I

150
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,820
guess student ml project regression so

151
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,340
I've selected this it will be the main

152
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,660
branch now the next thing we will do

153
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,060
just go ahead and create review plus

154
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:32,919
create okay now in reviewer plus create

155
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,440
these are all the information that I

156
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,360
have now finally I will just go ahead

157
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,520
and click on the create button now this

158
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,160
initialization this deployment will take

159
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,080
some time uh around couple of minutes so

160
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,900
we'll wait till this deployment will

161
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,520
happen but as soon as this happened

162
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,500
right if I reload this page right there

163
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,320
will be an automatic workflow that will

164
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,120
be created and this workflow is

165
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
basically getting created with the help

166
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
of GitHub action so once you create this

167
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,220
web app you know says the deployment is

168
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,680
in progress you know automatically

169
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,660
inside this GitHub right inside this

170
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,880
GitHub repository that GitHub folder

171
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,620
workflow folder will also get created so

172
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,960
we'll wait for some time you know and

173
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,479
we'll see that how this particular

174
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:14,979
folder will get created uh till the

175
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:17,139
deployment is basically happening okay

176
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,759
so let's wait for some time

177
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
so finally guys the deployment is

178
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,840
complete now now see what will happen

179
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,880
once the deployment happens I will go to

180
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:26,979
my GitHub page and I'll just reload it

181
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,380
automatically one additional folder has

182
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:31,419
got created which is called as GitHub

183
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:32,919
workflows okay now with respect to

184
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,319
GitHub workflows right if you probably

185
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,060
go ahead and click it and if you see

186
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,340
this file right this is the yaml file

187
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,319
that is got created

188
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:42,759
and it is basically saying that okay

189
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,740
build and deploy python app to Azure web

190
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,960
app right on push the main branch it is

191
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,620
basically considering the main branch

192
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,060
from where the code needs to be

193
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,319
dispatched to the server then it is

194
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:56,139
running on Ubuntu latest you know

195
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,300
basically in the server side if you

196
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:00,639
probably see these steps using actions

197
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,740
checkout you know this is basically

198
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,180
going to push the Repository

199
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,100
then you have what python version is

200
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:08,139
there then you have

201
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,060
starting with creating this particular V

202
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,340
and V environment like how we started

203
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,080
then the source it is basically

204
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,880
activating that then it is installing

205
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,039
all the dependencies then it is

206
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,020
deploying all the artifact of the

207
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,060
deployment job okay it is going inside

208
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:23,979
that inside this particular environment

209
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,199
then you can see this is basically my

210
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,300
web app URL which is it is picking up

211
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:30,099
from the secret key I'll show you the

212
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:31,539
secret key also which will be completely

213
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,520
unique then you have this entire steps

214
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:36,699
that is basically happening to deploy

215
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:38,139
and automatically it has created and

216
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:40,419
this is also super important which is

217
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,860
called as the Publix profile now how

218
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:44,139
this all information is basically coming

219
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:45,699
because we had already authenticated

220
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,319
right and if I probably go and see in

221
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,900
the settings and there will be an option

222
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:51,819
of secret and variable right so here you

223
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,460
will be seeing that this particular

224
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:55,539
secret variable has got created right in

225
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,880
the GitHub Azure app Service public

226
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,620
profile this name right and from this

227
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,960
entire information from this this

228
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,060
particular secret key whatever

229
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,740
information is basically present that is

230
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,199
basically read inside this particular

231
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,120
workflow see inside this vertical

232
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,220
profile like you require this app

233
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,620
service publish profile it is coming

234
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,120
from there you require this deploy to

235
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,280
web out whichever web URL is there that

236
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,620
is also reading from here it is also uh

237
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,560
reading some more informations with

238
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,940
respect to that now see

239
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:27,099
this is what is the GitHub action is

240
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,960
doing it is creating this entire EML

241
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:30,879
file which will have the necessary

242
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:32,379
configuration

243
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,520
now you can obviously see the

244
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,260
documentation page to understand each

245
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
and every step like what is it deploy

246
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,860
what is the steps and all but if you

247
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,080
really want me to make a dedicated video

248
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,360
on GitHub action step by step I'm happy

249
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,120
to make it just please make sure that

250
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,399
you make this particular video reach

251
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,200
1000 likes okay if you are able to do

252
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,240
that I'll start the series with respect

253
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,620
to GitHub action and I'll just turn it

254
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
to uh you know probably talk about this

255
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,120
step by step like what is this

256
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,620
particular parameter is basically saying

257
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,180
what is this completely detail you will

258
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
try to understand okay I'm kidding you

259
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:04,899
don't need to give even thousand likes

260
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,580
but I will make a dedicated GitHub

261
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,560
actions video okay uh it's just to say

262
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,500
you then only you basically like or

263
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,180
share my video with everyone okay but

264
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,760
don't worry if you don't like it also I

265
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,160
will make sure that I will try to create

266
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:19,839
a dedicated video on this but I really

267
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,580
wanted to show step by step how this is

268
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,920
automatically getting created

269
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,660
now as soon as uh this deployment

270
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,360
happened your deployment is complete

271
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,980
right you see in the GitHub action

272
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,680
in the GitHub action you will be able to

273
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,080
see

274
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,800
all this build and deployment has

275
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,200
actually happened in the build all the

276
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,600
steps like what is the setup job in the

277
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,540
yaml file it was run action checkout

278
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,760
right so what is basically happening

279
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,200
inside this it is syncing with this

280
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,180
repository it is getting the GitHub

281
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,500
version it is basically seeing this app

282
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,500
Runner right app Runner is what that

283
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:55,839
automatically deployment happens

284
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,040
whenever the changes are happening it is

285
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,140
initializing the repository it is doing

286
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,880
some steps like fetching repository and

287
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,160
all all the steps you'll be able to see

288
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:04,839
over here then set up python version

289
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,120
this is the second step with respect to

290
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,560
the deployment that has happened then we

291
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,080
went and created a virtual environment

292
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,120
installed all the dependencies with

293
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,860
respect to requirement.txtc

294
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,420
automatically all these things are so in

295
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,399
that ml file whatever is the steps

296
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,980
written right that entire steps is

297
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,600
basically happening line by line then we

298
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,640
upload the entire artifact in the form

299
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,260
of zip file inside the cloud okay

300
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,680
the Azure Cloud so this particular step

301
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,300
has also happened Post Run checkout so

302
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,700
here also you can see that

303
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,440
whatever cleanup is required after the

304
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,140
GitHub repository has been synced with

305
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
the cloud and then finally we complete

306
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,800
the job after build we basically do the

307
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,200
deployment now in deployment also you

308
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,300
can see setup objects download artifacts

309
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
and deploy towards your web app has

310
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,860
happened so if you really want to

311
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720
understand that particular yaml file you

312
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,060
just need to see this step by step what

313
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,500
has happened okay and then you will be

314
00:10:57,779 --> 00:10:58,779
able to get an idea but don't worry I'll

315
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,760
make a dedicated video about GitHub

316
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,440
action because to discuss about each and

317
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:04,899
everything right it will take around one

318
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,279
and a half hour

319
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,480
so uh this deployment has been done and

320
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,180
your url is also ready so I'll go and

321
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,820
click with respect to GitHub action C

322
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,920
when first time I ran it became wrong

323
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,620
because there was some problem but

324
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,360
automatically you'll be able to see that

325
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,920
this has been happen and this is what is

326
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,600
My URL now once I hit this URL you'll be

327
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:25,779
able to see the entire project is

328
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:28,839
available right now I will go and hit

329
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,600
some values okay automatically and this

330
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,720
is now running in Azure web okay 43 fair

331
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:37,779
this this okay and I'll submit it now

332
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,720
once I submitted it will basically do

333
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,240
the prediction and here you can see

334
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,500
prediction gemstone price is one six

335
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,180
eight four one again I've kept this

336
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,240
photo because again most of the credits

337
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,880
right with respect to the project

338
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,260
implementation goes to utkarsh right so

339
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,420
that is the reason I'm putting this

340
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,800
entire URL

341
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,060
now all you have to do is that take this

342
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:00,339
entire repository which I will be giving

343
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:02,019
you and

344
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'll give my repository only where it

345
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:05,980
has all the information with respect to

346
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,360
cash and then use Azure web to basically

347
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,240
do the deployment now once you do the

348
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,160
deployment once you test it the next

349
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:13,839
thing is that please delete this okay

350
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,760
please delete the deployment because

351
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,620
there may be some additional charges

352
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,060
just for practice purpose I've actually

353
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,160
created this so that you don't have to

354
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,660
worry about it okay so uh it has got

355
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,420
deleted now what I'll do is that I will

356
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:27,339
also delete this okay

357
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,760
so let me do one thing and here uh this

358
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,360
is delete okay so I'm just going to

359
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,300
click on delete and I have to just type

360
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,220

361
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,260
prediction you need to do this otherwise

362
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,300
you don't know what will happen but

363
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,800
automatically the money will get

364
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,120
deducted because you may require a

365
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,920
credit card over here but just to show

366
